Smart Resume Screening SystemOverviewThe&nbsp;Smart Resume Screening System&nbsp;is an AI-powered tool designed to automate the process of screening resumes and matching them with job descriptions. It uses natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and rule-based techniques to evaluate resumes based on skills, experience, education, and other criteria. The system also includes fraud detection, sentiment analysis, and email notifications for rejected candidates.FeaturesResume Parsing:Extracts text from PDF resumes.Parses candidate information such as name, contact details, skills, education, and experience.Job Description Parsing:Extracts key details from job descriptions, including job title, required experience, location, salary range, and skills.Skill Matching:Compares candidate skills with job requirements using weighted cosine similarity.Allows customization of skill weights for better matching.Fraud Detection:Detects plagiarism by comparing resumes with a database of existing resumes.Checks for suspicious gaps in work experience.Validates educational institutions against a list of valid institutions.Sentiment Analysis:Analyzes the sentiment of resume text using a pre-trained BERT model.Provides a sentiment score and label (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral).Email Notifications:Sends personalized rejection emails to candidates with feedback on skills lacking and match score.Dashboard Analytics:Displays statistics such as total resumes screened, suitability percentage, average match score, and top skills lacking.Report Generation:Generates CSV reports of screened resumes and sentiment analysis results.Modules1.&nbsp;email_sender.pyFunctionality: Sends rejection emails to candidates.Key
